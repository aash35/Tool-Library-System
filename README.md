# Tool Library System
CAB301 - Algorithms and Complexity

### Languages/Frameworks
- C#

This system makes use of different algorithmic techniques and data structures to create a library system that adheres to predefined interfaces. With the given interfaces we were to create unquie solutions to a set of problem while keeping the time complexity low. The main feature of the program was the "most borrowed tools" section. For this feature a heapsort algorithm was incorporated to keep the time complexity as `O(nlogn)`.

### Default Admin Credentials:
- **User** - staff
- **Password** - today123

## Usage 

The program is completely empty and needs to be populated by the admin  
Note that there is no persistent storage however there are testing methods inside the ToolLibrarySystem.cs class (need to be called upon)
1) Open the staff login menu and enter "Default Admin Credentials"
2) Add tools
3) Register new members
4) The system is setup for use
